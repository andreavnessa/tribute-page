	<h5 id="title-books"> Animal Farm (1945) </h5> 
	<p> 	Animal Farm is a unique Orwellian allegory of Stalinism and any totalitarian system. George Orwell was a fervent supporter of socialism, namely anarcho-syndicalism, as well as Trotskyism. Orwell believed that the Soviet Union was far from a true socialist country, but just another form of a totalitarian state. Some years after Homage to Catalonia, he decided to write down his experience and ideas on this subject in a more eloquent, symbolically appealing and all-encompassing way. In said animal farm, two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, motivated by the revolutionary ideas of a recently deceased pig, Old Major, lead a revolution supported by all animals. Their bosses, the humans, are forced to leave the farm and the pigs start organizing a regime of complete equity. However, Napoleon’s thirst for power soon results in Snowball’s exile and the creation of a totalitarian regime with the motto: ‘All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others’. </p>

	<h5 id="title-books"><br> 1984 (1948) <br></h5>
	
	<p> When 1984 was first published, it was regarded as the imaginary description of a dystopian society of the future. Now many people believe that this society belongs to the past, claiming that our current situation is even worse. No matter what one’s personal beliefs may be on the subject, this novel is undoubtedly one of the greatest of the previous century. Within the framework of the totalitarian regime of the Big Brother, everyone and everything is being watched and recorded at all times via countless interactive televisions. Everything has to be adjusted according to the one and only truth, the one propagated by the Party and its only true representative mechanism, the Big Brother, who has complete control over everyone’s actions and consciousness. The ultimate crime is the crime of thought – freedom, language and feelings have to disappear, anyone who resists is sentenced to death. This political manifesto against any and all totalitarian systems has been translated into 65 languages and has sold millions of copies. ‘Big Brother’, the ‘Newspeak‘ and ‘Doublethink’ are unique conceptions of a wonderful mind that history will remember.
